## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) - JS Animation library
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learnt alot about positioning elements relatively or absolutely to its container which helped in building out the Phone App UI and the background patterns
- I also learnt about animations using GSAP (A JavaScript Animation Library) as this is my first time using a javascript library. It is a fun and easy library to work with

### Continued development

I want to start learning React as it is a great JS framework for building complex apps and websites. And I also feel I've not used the superpower of Sass lol, so I'll continue learning but I think I'll focus more on React now

### Useful resources

- You can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqOhQWbouCE) if you're interested in learning about GSAP
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning) - This helped me understand positioning in CSS better
